# Documentation Directory (`docs/`)

## Overview
The `docs/` directory contains all **technical and user-facing documentation** related to the **Example Python Project**. It serves as a knowledge base for developers, contributors, and maintainers to **understand, use, and extend the project effectively**. This includes API documentation, service explanations, system architecture, configuration details, and best practices.

## Documentation Guidelines
- **API Documentation:** Should include:
  - Endpoint definitions (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` operations)
  - Request and response formats (JSON, XML, etc.)
  - Example requests and expected outputs
  - Authentication and rate-limiting details

- **Service Documentation:** Should explain:
  - The role of each service and how it interacts with other components
  - Business logic implemented within the service
  - Expected inputs and outputs

- **Model Documentation:** Should describe:
  - The structure of database entities
  - Relationships between models
  - Constraints and validation rules
  - Example ORM queries

- **Repository Documentation:** Should include:
  - The abstraction of data persistence layers
  - SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, or raw SQL implementations
  - Best practices for database transactions and queries

- **Middleware Documentation:** Should explain:
  - How middleware intercepts requests and responses
  - Authentication, logging, rate-limiting, and exception handling

- **Worker Documentation:** Should describe:
  - Background job execution strategies (Celery, RQ, AsyncIO)
  - Use cases for scheduled tasks and event-driven execution

- **CLI Documentation:** Should provide:
  - Instructions for running management scripts
  - Database migration, data seeding, and maintenance commands

- **Security Documentation:** Should outline:
  - Authentication mechanisms (JWT, OAuth, API Keys, etc.)
  - Authorization and access control best practices
  - Data encryption and secure storage considerations

- **Search Documentation:** Should cover:
  - Search engine integration (Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL Full-Text Search, etc.)
  - Indexing strategies and performance optimizations
  - Query execution and ranking algorithms

- **Deployment Documentation:** Should explain:
  - How to set up and deploy the project
  - CI/CD workflows and automation strategies
  - Environment configuration and scaling considerations

## Generating Documentation (if using Sphinx)
This project supports **Sphinx** for documentation generation. To build and serve the documentation locally:
```bash
cd docs
make html
# Open _build/html/index.html in a browser
```

If Markdown is preferred, ensure that `mkdocs` or another static documentation generator is used.

## Best Practices
- **Keep documentation up to date** with code changes.
- **Use clear, structured formatting** to improve readability.
- **Include code examples** to illustrate concepts.
- **Follow Markdown (`.md`) or reStructuredText (`.rst`) conventions** based on the documentation tool in use.
- **Ensure documentation is version-controlled** to reflect software changes.
