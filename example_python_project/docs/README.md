# Documentation Directory (`docs/`)

## Overview
The `docs/` directory contains all documentation related to the **Example Python Project**. This includes API documentation, service explanations, configuration details, and overall project guidelines. The documentation is designed to help developers and contributors understand the structure, functionality, and usage of the project.

## Documentation Guidelines
- **API Documentation:** Should include endpoint details, request/response formats, and example usage.
- **Service Documentation:** Should explain the business logic and workflows handled by each service.
- **Model Documentation:** Should describe the structure of database entities and their relationships.
- **Repository Documentation:** Should detail data access patterns and database interactions.
- **Middleware Documentation:** Should describe middleware functions such as authentication and logging.
- **Worker Documentation:** Should explain background tasks and their execution methods.
- **CLI Documentation:** Should provide usage instructions for command-line scripts.
- **Security Documentation:** Should outline security mechanisms like authentication and authorization.
- **Search Documentation:** Should explain search engine integration and indexing strategies.

## Generating Documentation (if using Sphinx)
To build and serve the documentation locally:
```bash
cd docs
make html
# Open _build/html/index.html in a browser
```

## Best Practices
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes.
- Use clear and concise language.
- Include examples where applicable.
- Follow Markdown (`.md`) or reStructuredText (`.rst`) formatting guidelines based on the documentation tool used.
