# Example Python Project (`src/example_python_project/`)

## Overview
This directory contains the core implementation of the **Example Python Project**. It serves as the main package and organizes all the business logic, API endpoints, services, repositories, models, utilities, and configurations.

## Directory Structure
```

## Modules Explained
- **`api/`** – Houses RESTful API implementations using Flask or Django.
- **`services/`** – Contains business logic and service implementations.
- **`models/`** – Defines database entities using ORM (SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, etc.).
- **`repositories/`** – Handles database interactions and abstracted queries.
- **`utils/`** – Stores utility functions like logging, validation, encryption, etc.
- **`config/`** – Configuration settings for the application.
- **`middleware/`** – Middleware functions for request processing and authentication.
- **`cli/`** – CLI tools for migrations, scheduled tasks, and maintenance.
- **`workers/`** – Background task execution using Celery or similar tools.
- **`security/`** – Security mechanisms for authentication and access control.
- **`main.py`** – The main entry point that initializes and starts the application.

## Running the Application
```bash
# Start the application
python src/example_python_project/main.py
```

## Best Practices
- Follow a modular design for maintainability.
- Keep business logic in services, separate from API controllers.
- Maintain high test coverage for all components.
- Use environment variables for sensitive configurations.
