# Example Python Project (`src/example_python_project/`)

## Overview
This directory contains the core implementation of the **Example Python Project**. It serves as the main package and organizes all **business logic, API endpoints, services, repositories, models, utilities, and configurations**. This structure ensures the project is modular, scalable, and maintainable for enterprise-level applications.

## Modules Explained
### `api/`
Contains API implementations using Flask, Django, or FastAPI. This module exposes application functionalities through **RESTful or GraphQL endpoints**.

### `services/`
Encapsulates **business logic** to keep APIs and controllers clean. Services handle request validation, transformations, and core application logic.

### `models/`
Defines **database models** using an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) such as **SQLAlchemy or Django ORM**. Models represent database entities and include relationships, constraints, and validation logic.

### `repositories/`
Handles **data persistence** and abstracts database interactions. This layer prevents direct queries in services, making data access more maintainable and testable.

### `utils/`
Includes reusable **utility functions**, such as logging, encryption, and data transformation.

### `config/`
Manages **configuration settings**, environment variables, and constants to make the application easily configurable across different environments.

### `middleware/`
Implements **middleware functions** that intercept requests and responses for logging, authentication, rate-limiting, and exception handling.

### `cli/`
Provides **command-line interface scripts** for administrative tasks, database migrations, and scheduled jobs.

### `workers/`
Handles **asynchronous background processing**, including task queues (Celery, Redis Queue, etc.), scheduled jobs, and event-driven execution.

### `security/`
Manages **security concerns**, including JWT-based authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and CSRF protection.

### `main.py`
Serves as the **application entry point**, initializing configurations, services, and API routes before running the server.

## Running the Application
```bash
# Start the application
python src/example_python_project/main.py
```

For a production deployment:
```bash
# Run with Gunicorn (for Flask/Django APIs)
gunicorn example_python_project.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000

# Run with Uvicorn (for FastAPI or ASGI applications)
uvicorn example_python_project.asgi:application --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Best Practices
- **Follow a modular design** to separate concerns for maintainability.
- **Keep business logic in services**, separate from API controllers.
- **Use repositories for database interactions** instead of direct queries in services.
- **Ensure high test coverage** for all components using unit and integration tests.
- **Utilize environment variables** for sensitive configurations.
- **Implement security best practices**, including authentication and encryption.
