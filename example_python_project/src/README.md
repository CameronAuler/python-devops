# Source Directory (`src/`)

## Overview
The `src/` directory contains all source code for the **Example Python Project**. This directory houses the core application logic, structured in a modular and maintainable way, following best practices for enterprise-level Python development.

## Modules Explained
### `api/`
Contains RESTful API implementations using Flask or Django.

### `services/`
Encapsulates business logic, ensuring separation of concerns from controllers and models.

### `models/`
Defines the structure of database entities using an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Django ORM).

### `repositories/`
Handles database interactions and abstracts direct queries.

### `utils/`
Utility functions such as logging, validation, encryption, etc.

### `config/`
Houses application-wide settings, constants, and configurations.

### `middleware/`
Contains middleware functions for request processing, authentication, and logging.

### `cli/`
Command-line interface scripts for database migrations, cron jobs, and maintenance tasks.

### `workers/`
Handles background task processing using Celery or similar tools.

### `security/`
Includes security-related modules such as JWT authentication, permissions, and CSRF protection.

### `main.py`
The entry point of the application, responsible for initializing and starting the app.

## Running the Application
```bash
# Start the application
python src/example_python_project/main.py
```
