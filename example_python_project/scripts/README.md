# Scripts Directory (`scripts/`)

## Overview
The `scripts/` directory contains utility scripts for **automating the setup, deployment, and maintenance** of the **Example Python Project**. These scripts help streamline repetitive tasks such as **environment setup, deployment, database migrations, testing, and server management**. Automating these processes reduces human error and ensures consistency across different environments.

## Directory Structure
```
scripts/
├── deploy.sh        # Automates application deployment
├── setup_env.sh     # Sets up environment variables
├── start_server.sh  # Starts the application server
├── run_tests.sh     # Runs unit and integration tests
├── backup_db.sh     # Backs up the database (if applicable)
├── restore_db.sh    # Restores a database backup
├── cleanup.sh       # Cleans up temporary files and logs
├── README.md        # Documentation for scripts directory
```

## Scripts Explained
### `deploy.sh`
- **Purpose:** Automates the deployment process for production environments.
- **What It Does:**
  - Pulls the latest code from the repository.
  - Installs or updates required dependencies.
  - Runs database migrations (if applicable).
  - Restarts the application server.
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  ./scripts/deploy.sh
  ```

### `setup_env.sh`
- **Purpose:** Configures environment variables for the project.
- **What It Does:**
  - Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
  - Exports necessary variables for local development and production.
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  source scripts/setup_env.sh
  ```

### `start_server.sh`
- **Purpose:** Launches the application server (Flask, Django, or FastAPI, depending on the project).
- **What It Does:**
  - Reads the environment configuration.
  - Starts the application using Gunicorn, Uvicorn, or the default Python development server.
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  ./scripts/start_server.sh
  ```

### `run_tests.sh`
- **Purpose:** Runs all unit, integration, and functional tests.
- **What It Does:**
  - Executes test cases using `pytest`.
  - Generates coverage reports.
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  ./scripts/run_tests.sh
  ```

### `backup_db.sh`
- **Purpose:** Creates a backup of the application’s database.
- **What It Does:**
  - Dumps the database to a file for backup.
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  ./scripts/backup_db.sh
  ```

### `restore_db.sh`
- **Purpose:** Restores a database from a backup file.
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  ./scripts/restore_db.sh backup_file.sql
  ```

### `cleanup.sh`
- **Purpose:** Cleans up temporary files and logs to free up space and maintain system hygiene.
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  ./scripts/cleanup.sh
  ```

## Best Practices
- **Ensure scripts are executable:** Run `chmod +x script_name.sh` to make them executable on UNIX-based systems.
- **Follow security best practices:** Avoid storing sensitive data (such as credentials) directly in scripts. Use environment variables instead.
- **Keep scripts modular:** Each script should perform a single, well-defined task.
- **Document all new scripts:** Update this `README.md` file whenever a new script is added.
- **Test before deploying:** Always test deployment and maintenance scripts in a staging environment before applying them to production.
